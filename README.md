# Raf's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project encapsulates my journey as a developer, showcasing my skills, projects, and what I've learned along the way. Dive in to learn more about me and how to run the portfolio on your own machine.

## Introduction

Creating this portfolio has been an enlightening experience. It's not just about showcasing my work; it's a testament to my growth as a developer. Throughout the process, I've acquired new skills, refined my coding style, and developed a deeper appreciation for the art of web development.

## What I've Learned

### Vite:

-- **Fast Development Environment**: Learned how Vite leverages native ES modules to serve files, leading to lightning-fast cold server starts and offering hot module replacement.

-- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Explored Vite's rich plugin system, allowing for easy integration of tools and libraries, and understood how Vite plugins differ from traditional webpack loaders.

-- **Optimized Builds**: Gained insights into Vite's build process, which utilizes Rollup under the hood, ensuring small production bundles and efficient tree shaking.

### React:

-- **Component-Based Architecture**: Grasped the modular nature of React, building reusable components that manage their own state and life cycles.

-- **Hooks**: Deepened understanding of React hooks, allowing for functional components to access state, effects, contexts, and more, leading to cleaner and more intuitive code.

-- **Context and Global State**: Learned to manage global state using the Context API, understanding its benefits in prop-drilling avoidance and creating a more structured application state.

### Tailwind:

-- **Utility-First CSS**: Embraced the utility-first methodology, constructing UIs faster by applying utility classes directly to HTML elements without writing custom CSS.

-- **Customization**: Delved into Tailwind's configuration file, tailoring the framework to fit specific design requirements by overriding default values and adding new utilities.

-- **JIT (Just-In-Time) Mode**: Explored Tailwind's JIT mode, which generates styles on-demand, ensuring smaller stylesheets in production and enabling the use of dynamic values in utility classes.

### Web Dev Lessons

- **Responsive Design**: Learned the importance of making web applications look and function well across all device types.

- **Animation Integration**: Integrated Lottie animations using the react-lottie package, understanding the nuances of integrating third-party libraries.

- **Performance Optimization**: Adopted best practices to ensure the portfolio loads swiftly, offering a seamless experience to visitors.

- **State Management in React**: Deepened my understanding of React hooks and state management to create dynamic, interactive components.

## Running the Portfolio Locally
If you're interested in exploring the portfolio's code or want to run it on your own machine, here's a step-by-step guide.

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Steps to run
1. Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
`git clone git@github.com:rafsanzi-ludhi/rafsanzani_io.git`

2. Navigate to the Directory

bash - copy code:

cd rafsanzani_io

3. Install Dependencies

To install all the required packages and libraries, run:

Terminal;

`npm install
`
4. Create a Build

Compile and optimize the portfolio for the best performance:

Terminal:

npm run build

5. Run the Portfolio

Once the build is ready, you can start the portfolio using:

Terminal:

`npm start
`gi

This will launch the portfolio on a local server. You can view it by going to http://localhost:3000/ (or whatever port is specified) in your browser.
